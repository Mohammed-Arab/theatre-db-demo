FUNCTIONS TO ADD (IDK if we need these tbh, cuz idk whats going to use them)
    - GetDuesStatusForMember(memberID) → Paid vs Owed
    - GetTotalSponsorshipForProduction(productionID)
    - GetTotalTicketRevenue(productionID)
    - GetNetBalance(productionID) — alt to current summary proc
    - GetPatronPurchaseHistory(patronID)

1) Test all SQL code thoroughly, once tested apply changes to webapp.
2) Test all functionality through the webapp to ensure front to backend is working as expected.
    Note: all procedures are called through the same code, if one works they should all work,
          this also goes for functions and views which have their own way to call them but all 
          instances of them use there respective function.
3) Ensure nothing is missing - create and test it if missing.
4) Make website pretty
5) Create submission doc - currently were around 3200 lines of code in this repo which is roughly
   65-70 pages, spencer will email the prof about submission. (pdf or pdf and zip of repo)

Currently known errors:
During csv import only production_play table isn't populated, this error extents to AddPlayToProduction, 
the error: Unknown column 'PlayID' in 'feild list' - yet the csv is correct, the loading code is correct 
and the correct table with the correct column exists in the db, tbh I'm at a loss with this error I've 
spent like 3hrs on it.
